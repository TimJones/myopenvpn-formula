Available states
================

.. contents::
    :local:

``openvpn``
-----------
Installs the OpenVPN package.

``openvpn.server``
------------------
Configures OpenVPN server instances using data from Pillar.

Example minimum Pillar:

.. code:: yaml

    openvpn:
      minimal-example: # Name of instance, must be unique per host
        ca_cert: |
          # Public CA Certificate should go here
        cert: |
          # Server's public certificate should go here
        key: |
          # Server's private key should go here
        ta_key: |
          # Public TLS Authentication key should go here
        dh: |
          # Diffie-Helman Parameters should go here

``openvpn.client``
------------------
Configures OpenVPN client instances using data from Pillar.

Example minimum Pillar:

.. code:: yaml

    openvpn:
      minimal-example: # Name of instance, must be unique per host
        remotes:
          - server: 123.123.123.123 # Reachable IP address of OpenVPN server
        ca_cert: |
          # Public CA Certificate should go here
        cert: |
          # Client's public certificate should go here
        key: |
          # Client's private key should go here
        ta_key: |
          # Public TLS Authentication key should go here
